@article{Tenorth2011,
    abstract = {As robots are starting to perform everyday manipulation tasks, such as cleaning up, setting a table, or preparing simple meals, their control programs must become much more knowledgeable than they are today. Typically, everyday manipulation tasks are vaguely specified, and the robot must therefore infer by itself how to do the appropriate actions on objects in an appropriate manner to accomplish these tasks. These inferences can only be done if the robot has access to the necessary knowledge, including knowledge about how the objects look, what their properties are, where they can be found, and what might happen if particular actions are performed on them.},

    abstract={Humans can use the Internet to share knowledge and to help each other accomplish complex tasks. Until now, robots have not taken advantage of this opportunity. Sharing knowledge between robots requires methods to effectively encode, exchange, and reuse data. In this article, we present the design and first implementation of a system for sharing knowledge between robots.},
