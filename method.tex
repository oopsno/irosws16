\subsection{Distributing ROS Service using Docker}
You can use an kind of technology to manage these containers.

\subsection{Managing multiple Nodes with same name}
\subsubsection{Mapping Container ID to host IP \& port}
Running a Key-Value storage engine (Radis for this case) to hold ports mapping status.

\subsubsection{Load Balancing}
Cannot findout real-time payload of a specified Node without modifying ROS client codes.

\subsection{Supporting Fallback}
Configuration on how does one node works. 

\subsection{Supporting private Nodes}
